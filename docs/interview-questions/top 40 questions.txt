# MUST-MASTER AKS PRINCIPAL INTERVIEW SET (~40 QUESTIONS)

## 1. Identity, Workload Identity, Secrets

1. Explain workload identity in AKS, including the end-to-end chain Pod → ServiceAccount → OIDC token → Entra ID → Managed Identity → Key Vault.
2. How does Workload Identity differ from the older MSI and AAD Pod Identity approaches, and what were the weaknesses of AAD Pod Identity?
3. When would you choose user-assigned managed identity vs system-assigned managed identity for workloads running on AKS?
4. How do you design least-privilege access for AKS workloads (per-pod/per-namespace identity, scoping in Entra ID, and Key Vault permissions)?
5. How do you securely distribute secrets to workloads (CSI driver vs synced Kubernetes Secrets) and what are the trade-offs?
6. How do you rotate secrets and Key Vault secrets used by pods without downtime or mass restarts?

## 2. Networking, Ingress, Private Connectivity

7. Compare Azure CNI and kubenet in detail, focusing on IP consumption, performance, and operational trade-offs in large clusters.
8. Explain north–south traffic flow for a private AKS workload exposed via Internet → Front Door (or APIM) → App Gateway → AKS Ingress → Service → Pod.
9. When would you front AKS with APIM, with App Gateway, or with Front Door? Give concrete decision criteria for each.	
10. How do you secure east–west traffic inside the cluster (network policies, service mesh, mTLS, and segmentation)?
11. When would you use Private Link for PaaS data-plane access from AKS, and how does that interact with hub–spoke VNets?
12. How do you design DNS for multi-region AKS deployments, including split-horizon, private zones, and failover?
13. How do Azure NAT Gateway and SNAT port limits affect AKS egress design at scale, and how do you mitigate SNAT exhaustion?

## 3. Scaling, HPA, KEDA, Backpressure

14. Why is CPU-based HPA often insufficient for event-driven workloads, and what alternative signals do you use for scaling?
15. How does KEDA scale based on queue length or Kafka lag, and how do you configure it safely for spiky traffic?
16. Distinguish HPA, KEDA, cluster autoscaler, and node autoscaling, and explain how they interact in a real system.
17. How do you design overload protection and load shedding inside AKS to protect critical services from being overwhelmed?
18. How do you prevent cascading failures across microservices (timeouts, retries, bulkheads, circuit breakers)?
19. What happens when a node pool hits max capacity, and how do you design capacity planning and guardrails around that?

## 4. Cluster Architecture, Isolation, When NOT to use AKS

20. How do you design node pools for workload isolation (system vs user workloads, CPU-bound vs memory-bound vs GPU, noisy neighbors)?
21. When do you choose separate node pools vs separate clusters (per environment, per tenant, per business unit)?
22. How would you design AKS for a multi-tenant SaaS product (per-tenant isolation model, shared vs dedicated resources, blast radius)?
23. When would you NOT use AKS at all, and instead use App Service, Functions, or other PaaS options?

## 5. Ingress, Mesh, Traffic Control

24. How does the NGINX ingress controller work under the hood, and what can make it a bottleneck at very high load?
25. When do you need a service mesh (Istio/Linkerd/etc.), and what concrete problems does it solve beyond basic ingress?
26. What is mTLS and how do you enforce it for service-to-service traffic inside AKS?
27. How do you implement rate limiting and per-service protection at the ingress layer?
28. How do you safely expose sensitive admin or internal endpoints in an AKS-based system?

## 6. High Availability & Multi-Region

29. How do you design AKS across multiple availability zones, and what are the main limitations or gotchas?
30. How do you deploy an application active-active across multiple regions on AKS, including traffic routing and failover?
31. How do you handle database geo-replication in a multi-region AKS design, and avoid split-brain in stateful workloads?
32. How do you coordinate DNS-level failover and preserve user experience during regional outages?

## 7. Security, RBAC, Policies, Supply Chain

33. What is the difference between Azure RBAC and Kubernetes RBAC, and how do you layer them effectively in a platform?
34. How do you enforce namespace isolation and Pod Security (PSS/PSA, restricted capabilities, no-privileged containers)?
35. How do you secure egress from AKS (egress lockdown, firewall, NAT, FQDN/endpoint controls)?
36. How do you enforce image provenance and supply chain security (ACR, signing, scanning, admission control / policy)?

## 8. State, Storage, Data Access

37. When is it a bad idea to run Kafka/RabbitMQ/Redis directly in AKS, and what alternatives do you prefer?
38. How do you avoid connection storms and database overload when many pods hit SQL or other stateful backends during scale-out?
39. How do you ensure correctness and consistency when scaling stateful handlers horizontally (idempotency, ordering, concurrency control)?

## 9. Observability, CI/CD, Failure Modes

40. Explain how metrics, logs, and traces flow end-to-end in an AKS platform (including OpenTelemetry) and how you design SLO-based alerting.
41. Explain GitOps vs CI/CD push deployments, how Flux (or Argo) reconciles state, and how you structure per-environment separation.
42. Walk through your approach when a rollout degrades cluster performance or causes a partial outage: what you check first, what you roll back, and how you learn from it.
43. Walk through your process for debugging: 
    - pods stuck in Pending, 
    - pods Running but not responding, 
    - ingress timeouts, and 
    - DNS failures inside AKS.
44. For .NET microservices on AKS, how do you prevent connection storms, socket exhaustion, and GC/memory issues during aggressive scaling?
